            <p>There's nothing quite like a hot cup of chamomile tea when you're feeling under the weather. Chamomile tea is known for its soothing and calming effects, and its delicious, light flavor.
                 Chamomile tea is a great choice if you're looking for an herbal tea that's easy to drink and doesn't have a strong flavor.
                 The relaxing properties are amazing on a rainy day or right before bed. My favorite way to make this is to blend it with a bit of lemongrass and serve on ice with agave syrup.</p>
